Installation
------------

Python package and command line interface (IDLE) for the analysis of whole genome duplications (WGDI). The environment required for installation is python3.

Method
""""""

We recommend using a python installation directly by using the commands available on PyPI:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install wgdi

upgrade with just one terminal command:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install --upgrade wgdi

Or use `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ to get the latest version of the source code on github, and install our program.

.. code-block:: python

   git clone https://github.com/SunPengChuan/wgdi.git
   cd wgdi
   python setup.py install

Third party software
""""""""""""""""""""

Some parts of WGDI use the following additional python libraries:

`paml <http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html>`_

`mafft <https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/>`_

`muscle <http://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm>`_

`pal2nal <http://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/#Download>`_

After you download and install the above package, create a new folder and then go to the folder to get to work.

We recommend installing ``Git`` to work with ``WGDI``, so you can quickly switch working directories when you start a large number of tasks.

Uninstall
"""""""""

If you don't need ``WGDI``, you can uninstall with ``pip uninstall wgdi``.

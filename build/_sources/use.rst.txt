* When a folder runs ``WGDI``, ``WGDI`` automatically generates results for you in the background, and you can exit the folder and go to the next folder to start working.
* ``WGDI`` performs the ``conf`` file for the current folder, so you can copy the ``conf`` file in bulk and make parameter modifications that apply to the target folder.
